						<p>Rob West left Glen Tee’s two-day tournament in Mesquite, NV, with considerably more luggage than when he arrived. Rob won the club championship with the trophy and the big money that goes with it, and… also went home with the trophy for the season-long B Flight championship. Not a bad weekend.</p>
						<p>The other winners in the flight championships were Robert Wilkes in C Flight and Vern Shaffer in A Flight. Well done guys.</p>
						<p>In the Mesquite doings, Rob took first in the net scoring over Shawn Gardner. Gross scoring honors at Mesquite went to Jeremy Campbell with a two-day total of 152 which was nine over par for the 36 holes. Vern was second at 157 trailed by Rob at 166.</p>
		  			<p>Note: Take a look at the new attached A,B and C flights for the coming season. It may be the last time that most of us get to see our names in first place.</p>
